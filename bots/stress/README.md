# ü§ñ Stress bot

A lightweight toolkit for app developers to test messaging functionality against XMTP bots.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (20.18.0)
- Yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-qa-testing
cd xmtp-qa-testing
yarn install
# Run the bot
yarn bot:stress
```

## üí¨ Available Commands

| Command            | Description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/stress [number]` | Start a stress test with the specified number of workers |
| `/stress reset`    | Terminate all workers and start over                     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```bash
LOGGING_LEVEL="off" # off, error, warn, info, debug, trace
XMTP_ENV="dev" # dev, production
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..." # OpenAI API key
```

## üß™ Considerations

- If a worker does not exist, its keys are created.
- If worker exists uses the existing env file keys and .data folder
- If the data folder doesnt exist, it creates one
- Workers prefixed with "random" have keys that are stored only in memory.

## Test Environment

- Device: [iPhone 16 Pro Max]
- Network: [Wifi]
- XMTP Environment: [dev]
- App Version: [1.0.0]
