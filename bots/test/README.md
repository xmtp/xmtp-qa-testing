## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```bash
LOGGING_LEVEL="off" # off, error, warn, info, debug, trace
XMTP_ENV="dev" # dev, production
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..." # OpenAI API key
```

## üß∞ Workers

Predefined personas like Bob, Joe, and Sam are initialized with the `getWorkers` function. For example:

```
const names = [
  "bob",
  "alice",
  "fabri",
  "bot",
  "elon",
  "joe",
  "charlie",
  "dave",
  "rosalie",
  "eve",
  "frank",
  "grace",
  "henry",
  "ivy",
  "jack",
  "karen",
  "larry",
  "mary",
  "nancy",
  "oscar",
  "paul",
]

const personas = await getWorkers(names, testName);
```

Considerations

- If a persona does not exist, its keys are created.
- If persona exists uses the existing env file keys and .data folder
- If the data folder doesnt exist, it creates one
- Personas prefixed with "random" have keys that are stored only in memory.

```

```
