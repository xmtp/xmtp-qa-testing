> The highlighted path (red dashed line) in the architecture diagram shows our main testing focus.

`LibXMTP` is a shared library built in Rust and compiled to WASM, Napi, and FFI bindings. It encapsulates the core cryptography functions of the XMTP messaging protocol. Due to the complexity of the protocol, we are using `openmls` as the underlying cryptographic library, it's important to test how this bindings perform in their own language environments.

We can test all XMTP bindings using three main applications. We use [xmtp.chat](https://xmtp.chat/) to test the Browser SDK's Wasm binding in actual web environments. We use [Convos](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/converse-app) to test the React Native SDK, which uses both Swift and Kotlin FFI bindings for mobile devices. We use [agents](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ/xmtp-agent-examples) to test the Node SDK's Napi binding for server functions. This testing method checks the entire protocol across all binding types, making sure different clients work together, messages are saved, and users have the same experience across the XMTP system.

### Testing details

- Multi-region testing nodes (`us-east`, `us-west` , `asia`, `europe` )
- 30-minute automated test execution intervals
- Comprehensive data aggregation in datadog
- Testing directly on top of SDKs for real-world scenarios
- `dev` and `production` network covered
- Automated testing for web app `xmtp.chat`
- Manual testing for react native app
- Human & agents testing for real-world simulations

### TLDR: Metrics

- **Core SDK Performance**: Direct message creation (<500ms), group operations (<200-500ms)
- **Network Performance**: Server call (<100ms), TLS handshake (<100ms), total processing (<300ms)
- **Group Scaling**: Supports up to 300 members efficiently (create: 9s, operations: <350ms)
- **Regional Performance**: US/Europe optimal, Asia/South America higher latency (+46-160%)
- **Message Reliability**: 100% delivery rate (target: 99.9%), perfect ordering
- **Environments**: Production consistently outperforms Dev network by 5-9%
